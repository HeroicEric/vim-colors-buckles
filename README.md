# Another vim colorscheme

I started this when I was given some inspiration from [Charles
Buckles](http://www.matt-buckley.com/). I've only really tested it out with Ruby
so everything else has the potential to look completely terrible. I plan on
updating this as I work with different filetypes.

## Installation

With [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle):

```
Bundle 'HeroicEric/vim-colors-buckles'
```

Or you can just put `colors/buckles.vim` into your `~/.vim/colors` directory.
